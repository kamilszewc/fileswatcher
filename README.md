# Files Watcher (DISCONTINUED)
**Development on the project stopped in 2023**

## General
This project aimed to streamline and simplify how Java applications detect changes to files and directories on the file system. We wanted to create a more robust and developer-friendly solution, abstracting away the complexities and inconsistencies inherent in Java's native file system watching mechanisms.

## Installation

The compiled libraries are deployed to Maven Central.

Usage with maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.kamilszewc</groupId>
    <artifactId>fileswatcher</artifactId>
    <version>0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Usage with gradle:

```groovy
implementation 'io.github.kamilszewc:fileswatcher:0.3'
```
